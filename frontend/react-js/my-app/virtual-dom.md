### 🧠 What is the **Virtual DOM** in React?

Think of the **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** as a **lightweight copy of the real DOM** that React keeps in memory.

#### 🧩 Why do we need it?
The real DOM is **slow** to manipulate directly. So React:
1. **Builds a virtual representation** of the UI (Virtual DOM).
2. Makes changes to this virtual version when state or props change.
3. **Compares the new Virtual DOM with the old one** (diffing).
4. Updates **only the changed parts** in the actual DOM (real DOM).

This whole process makes UI updates **faster and more efficient**.

#### 🎨 Example:
```jsx
<div>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
</div>
```

If "Hello" changes to "Hi", React:
1. Updates the Virtual DOM with "Hi".
2. Diffs it with the previous version.
3. Sees that only the `<h1>` text changed.
4. Updates **just that part** in the real DOM.

### ⚙️ What is the **Reconciler** in React?

The **Reconciler** is the **brain behind Virtual DOM diffing and updating**.

#### It does 3 major things:
1. **Diffing** – compares old and new virtual DOM trees.
2. **Scheduling** – decides **when** and **what** to update.
3. **Committing** – applies the minimal DOM updates to the actual UI.

#### 🧪 React Fiber Reconciler
React’s current reconciler is called **Fiber**. It was introduced to:
- Break rendering work into chunks.
- **Pause and resume** work (great for large updates).
- Allow **concurrent rendering** in React 18+.

So when you hear “Concurrent Mode,” “useTransition,” or “Suspense,” Fiber is what makes them work behind the scenes.

### 🕹 In short:

| Concept        | Virtual DOM                         | Reconciler (Fiber)                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| What is it?    | In-memory representation of the DOM | Algorithm that handles diffing and rendering     |
| Purpose        | Improve performance of UI updates   | Decide **what**, **how**, and **when** to update |
| Used by        | React                              | React                                             |
| Key Feature    | Efficient updates via diffing       | Concurrent rendering, prioritization             |
